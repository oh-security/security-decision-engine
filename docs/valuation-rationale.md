# Security Decision Engine — Acquisition Valuation Rationale

## Executive Summary
This asset is an **execution-free Security Decision Layer** designed to be
embedded into existing platforms with minimal integration risk.
Its value is driven by **design completeness and integration leverage**, not
current revenue or customer count.

---

## Valuation Premises
- No execution, enforcement, or remediation
- All decisions are non-binding recommendations
- Human-defined policies (JSON)
- Deterministic decision model (show / suppress / snooze)
- Append-only audit logs (DecisionEvents)
- OpenAPI contract available
- Phase2 complete (no further implementation required pre-acquisition)

---

## Valuation Ranges and Rationale

### 🟢 300–500M JPY (Base Case)

**Rationale**
- Replaces months of internal design and validation work
- Extremely low integration and liability risk
- Immediately usable as an internal PoC or control layer

**Value Components**
- Decision logic and boundary design
- Audit-ready architecture
- Talent and design acquisition

**Internal Framing**
> “This accelerates internal roadmap execution with minimal downside.”

---

### 🔵 500–800M JPY (Strategic Case)

**Additional Value**
- Domain-agnostic decision layer
- UX improvement through alert suppression logic
- Reusable across multiple products or services

**Value Components**
- Shared decision logic across teams
- Reduced alert fatigue and operational noise
- Improved customer experience without UI changes

**Internal Framing**
> “This becomes a shared decision layer across our product portfolio.”

---

### 🔴 800–1000M JPY (Platform Case)

**Key Differentiators**
- Execution intentionally externalized
- Decision boundary treated as a first-class control plane
- Difficult to replicate without architectural foresight

**Value Components**
- Long-term control plane for decision standardization
- Foundation for future automation and intelligence
- Expansion beyond security into other decision-heavy domains

**Internal Framing**
> “This is not a feature. It is a platform primitive.”

---

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**
- No execution side effects
- No UI or workflow conflicts
- No customer-facing dependencies

**Residual Risk**
- Production data validation post-acquisition
- Market expansion dependent on integration strategy

All residual risks are **post-acquisition controllable**.

---

## Conclusion
> **This asset is acquisition-ready at Phase2.  
> The valuation is justified by integration value, not current revenue.**
