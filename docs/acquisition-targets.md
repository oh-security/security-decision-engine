# Acquisition Target Positioning

This document explains how the Security Decision Engine fits different
acquirer types and why it is acquisition-ready at Phase2.

---

## Cloud Service Providers (CSP)

### Core Problem
Security decision logic is fragmented across services, while execution
already exists in multiple enforcement layers.

### Positioning
This system acts as an execution-free decision layer that unifies
security judgment across services without touching existing enforcement.

### Why Acquire
- No conflict with existing execution mechanisms
- Unified decision logic across products
- Immediately embeddable as a shared control plane

## SaaS Vendors

### Core Problem
Too many alerts degrade user experience, while aggressive automation
introduces operational risk.

### Positioning
This system decides what matters today, improving user experience
without introducing automatic remediation risk.

### Why Acquire
- Improves UX without UI rework
- Reduces alert fatigue safely
- Fits existing product flows

## System Integrators / MSPs

### Core Problem
Security decisions are inconsistent, human-dependent, and difficult
to audit across customers.

### Positioning
This system standardizes decision logic, making security judgments
auditable, explainable, and repeatable.

### Why Acquire
- Reduces operational variance
- Simplifies audits and reporting
- Lowers dependence on individual expertise
